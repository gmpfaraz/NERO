# GULL - Accounting Management System

> **G**eneral **U**tility for **L**edger and **L**ogs

A specialized accounting management system designed for tracking and analyzing numerical data across different digit categories (2-digit "Akra" and 3-digit "Ring" entries).

## 🎯 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Project-Based Organization**: Create and manage multiple accounting projects
- **Dual-Category Entry System**: Support for 2-digit (00-99) and 3-digit (000-999) entries
- **Transaction Management**: Add, edit, delete, and track transactions with timestamps
- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex filters with mathematical operators
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic totaling and summary calculations
- **Data Export/Import**: Excel file support for data portability
- **Undo/Redo System**: Complete action history with revert capabilities
- **Visual Analytics**: Bar charts and visual data representations
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode with persistent preferences

### Technical Features
- Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities
- Real-time data synchronization
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Full TypeScript type safety

## 🎨 Design System

This project includes a comprehensive design system in `design-system.json` that defines:
- Color palettes (light mode optimized)
- Typography scales
- Component styling
- Spacing and layout
- Shadows and effects

### Using the Design System with AI

Reference the design system in your prompts to Cursor/AI:

```
"Use the design system defined in design-system.json to create a new stats card component"
```

```
"Apply the card component styling from design-system.json to this element"
```

```
"Ensure this follows the color palette and typography from our design system"
```

The design system ensures visual consistency across all components and provides AI with exact specifications for styling.
